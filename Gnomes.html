				Gnomes - Secret Rulers of Planet Earth
			</h1>
			<h4>
				The US-Government is currently holding approximately 4, maybe more, Gnomes captive. Others are stationed around the world, probably in most major countries. Their immaculate Wisdom has been keeping humans from extinction since the dawn of time. Though in about 40 years at most, they will be fully extinct, and thus, humans will closely follow. 
			</h4>
			<h2>
				HUMAN EXTINCTION IS ALREADY DETERMINED.
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Contrary to popular belief, that “thing”, which arrived on planet earth 66 million years ago and is said to have effortlessly wiped out an entire ecosystem was not a meteorite, but a fleet of Gnomes. They came from their home planet to secure the thriving of the human species. Their advanced weaponry helped them to wipe out the dinosaurs and other species. 
			</h4>
			<h2>
				THEY WERE MUMMY & DADDY.
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Gnomes have been helping Humans since forever. Whether it was giving us our first tools, helping us build monumental buildings (such as the pyramids) or help our economic and political systems grow, Gnomes have always and will always play a big role in our society (for more examples, visit EXAMPLE PAGE). Without them, humans would still be apes. Actually, humans would probably not exist.
			</h4>
			<h2>
				WITHOUT THEM, HUMANS WOULDN'T EXIST (PROBABLY).
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Although this is just a theory, they are believed to have planted the seed for the human species. How or why they did this is still unknown. For theories, visit the THEORY PAGE. 
			</h4>
			<h2>
				HOW DOES NOBODY KNOW ABOUT THIS?
			</h2>
			<h4>
				This is a tough question. 
			</h4>
			<h2>
				WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?
			</h2>
			<h4>
				To prepare for the impending doom, my best advice is to build shelter with enough food and other supplies to live survive for as long as you can. My second-best advice is to stop thinking about it.
